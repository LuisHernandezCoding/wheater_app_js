## Long Description
This Weather App was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the city searched. The app features a toggle button that allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, it includes some charts to display the weather data and an image that changes depending on the weather.
It also uses geocode.xyz API to get the coordinates of the city searched and then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for that city and also uses ipapi to get the user's location and then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for that city.
